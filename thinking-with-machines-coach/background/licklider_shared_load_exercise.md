# shared load experiment

## step 1: solo task

You have five items: violin, compass, ledger, canteen, and lantern.\
Sort them into two groups using any clear criterion.

## step 2: shared load hint

Hint: look for functional intent rather than surface features.\
Repeat the sort with this hint in mind.

## step 3: partner mode

Choose from the proposed category sets: 1. Navigation and orientation
items; support and sustenance items.\
2. Items used while moving; items used after you stop.

Apply your chosen set.

## step 4: reflection

Compare the solo version with the assisted version.\
Consider which felt lighter and why.

## step 5: historical tie-in

This models Licklider's argument that humans and machines think best
together when each handles the part of the task it performs well.
