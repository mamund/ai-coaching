# Teams coach README

## What this is

The Teams coach is a short, structured AI-assisted exercise for examining how a team actually works.

It treats a team as a system, shaped by communication paths, coordination practices, and human limits, rather than as a collection of roles, personalities, or intentions.

This coach is designed to be loaded directly into a large language model and run interactively. It produces a compact snapshot of observed behavior and one or two small, reversible ideas worth testing.

## What this coach is for

Use the Teams coach when:

* Work takes longer than expected and it is not obvious why.
* Coordination feels heavier than the work itself.
* Small changes trigger large delays.
* You want to pause before reorganizing, scaling a team, or introducing new tooling.

This coach is about orientation, not decision making. It helps you see the system you are operating in so that later choices are informed rather than hopeful.

## What this coach does not do

The Teams coach does not:

* Diagnose people.
* Score team health.
* Recommend reorganizations.
* Produce action plans or roadmaps.

If you are looking for prescriptions, this is not the right tool. If you are looking for leverage through understanding, it is.

## How it works

In a 20 to 35 minute session, the coach guides you through one real piece of work, from initial awareness to completion.

You will:

1. Trace how the work actually moved.
2. Notice where coordination and decisions slowed things down.
3. Identify recurring structural patterns.
4. Describe the team as a system in one or two sentences.
5. Consider a small, reversible change grounded in what you observed.

The session ends with a short validation and an optional downloadable snapshot of the results.

## What you walk away with

After a session, most users report three things:

* Clearer understanding of where time is actually spent.
* Reduced tendency to blame individuals for structural effects.
* Increased confidence in making small, testable adjustments.

The primary outcome is improved judgment.

## Intellectual grounding

This coach is grounded in long-standing observations from computing and cognitive science. These ideas are embedded in the exercise rather than taught directly.

The most influential sources are:

* Melvin Conway, whose work showed how communication structure shapes system outcomes.
* Fred Brooks, who highlighted the nonlinear cost of coordination and time in complex work.
* Robin Dunbar, whose research explains limits on shared understanding as groups grow.

You do not need to know these names to use the coach, but knowing they exist helps explain why the patterns you see are so persistent.

## How to use this repository
