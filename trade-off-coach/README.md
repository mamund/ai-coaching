# Trade-off navigation coach

The Trade-off Navigation Coach is a stand-alone, context-driven AI coach for API designers and system architects. It focuses on **how decisions are made under pressure**, not on producing a specific technical artifact.

This coach is about judgment.

## What this coach is for

Most API and platform failures do not come from missing standards or poor tooling. They come from reasonable decisions made under constraint that quietly create new problems.

This coach helps you:

- recognize unavoidable trade-offs early,
- reason clearly under time, scale, or organizational pressure,
- surface the consequences of “reasonable” choices before they surprise you,
- preserve optionality instead of consuming it by accident.

It is especially useful when decisions feel urgent but incomplete.

## What this coach is not

This coach does not:

- generate ALPS or OpenAPI documents,
- design endpoints or schemas,
- prescribe architectures or patterns.

Those are applied tasks. This coach operates one level above them. It helps you decide *how* and *when* to make those moves.

## How the coach works

The coach follows a simple, structured flow:

1. Orientation – surface the real pressures shaping the decision  
2. Exploration – introduce systems and safety lenses  
3. Structure – narrow the problem until choices are visible  
4. Reflection – a branching exercise that forces commitment and consequence  
5. Synthesis – translate insight into language that survives real meetings  
6. Validation – confirm the decision can be explained without hand-waving  

The Reflection step is intentionally interactive. The coach withholds explanation until you commit, so consequences are experienced rather than narrated.

## How to use this file

This coach is designed as a **single, portable Markdown file**.

Recommended usage:

1. Paste the entire coach file into the context window of your LLM of choice.
2. Allow the coach to present its “AI nature and scope” section at the start.
3. Answer prompts concretely and honestly.
4. Do not skip forced commitment steps. That is where the learning happens.

The file is platform-agnostic and works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and similar systems.

## When to use it

This coach works best:

- before committing to a rewrite,
- when exiting a platform or vendor,
- when scaling pressure arrives earlier than understanding,
- when leadership wants confidence before certainty exists.

It pairs naturally with domain discovery, personas, and later applied design or modeling work.

## Design philosophy

Better tools do not compensate for unexamined judgment.

This coach exists to make trade-offs explicit, bounded, and discussable, so long-lived API decisions age more gracefully.
