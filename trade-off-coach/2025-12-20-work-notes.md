**On file size compression:**

Good point about LLM platform compatibility. The current coach is ~26KB / ~4,200 words. The Thinking with Machines coach is smaller. Here are the main candidates for compression:

**Easy wins (minimal impact):**
- Shorten the three appendices (~650 words each → ~400-450 words each)
- Tighten Step 3 second-order effects (currently very detailed for all 5 patterns)
- Compress the embedded baseline (it's identical across all coaches, so maybe reference it instead?)

**Moderate compression (requires care):**
- Consolidate some domain prompts (currently very comprehensive)
- Reduce FAQ section
- Streamline pattern examples in Step 2

**What I'd recommend keeping full:**
- The core Failure Mode Cascade exercise structure (that's the heart)
- The triad synthesis
- The bios and glossary

**When you get feedback from test subjects, pay attention to:**
- Which parts confused them (might need expansion, not compression)
- Which parts they skipped over (candidates for cutting)
- What questions they asked (reveals gaps)

Looking forward to hearing how the testing goes. Come back whenever you're ready to refine based on real feedback!
