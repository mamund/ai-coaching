## 👥 Persona Profiles

### 👤 Persona 1 — Typical Neighbor

**Motivations**  
Occasionally needs a yard, automotive, or household tool to solve an immediate problem without having to buy or store it.

**Frustrations**  
Tools aren’t always available when needed. Sometimes they pick the wrong tool or can’t find one that was checked back in but never returned to its proper place.

**Skills & Tools**  
Comfortable using a mobile phone or laptop to reserve or check tool status. Knows basic tool use but often relies on YouTube videos for instructions or quick refreshers.

**Desired Outcome**  
Easily finds and reserves the right tool using the mobile app. When they arrive, it’s available and in its proper place. It works as expected, helps them solve their problem, and they return it on time — feeling satisfied and confident about using the system again.

**Empathy Map — Typical Neighbor**  
- **SAYS:** “I just need this one tool for a quick fix.”  
- **THINKS:** “I hope the tool I need is actually there.”  
- **FEELS:** Slight anxiety before borrowing; relief and pride when it works.  
- **DOES:** Checks app, reserves tool, uses it, and returns it on time.

**Desired Outcome**  
A predictable, low-stress workflow where the inventory is accurate, users respect borrowing rules, and reminders or alerts flag problems early.

- **SAYS:** “I just want to know what’s available and what needs fixing.”  
- **THINKS:** “If I keep it simple, more people will use it.”

## 🌐 Context Narrative — Shared Environment

In this neighborhood, tool sharing is both practical and social.  
The **Supervisor** ensures reliability and upkeep.  
The **Typical Neighbor** represents everyday use — quick, pragmatic borrowing.  
The **New Neighbor** tests how inclusive and approachable the system feels.  
The **Heavy User** pushes the system’s limits, surfacing its reliability and efficiency needs.

Together they form a balanced micro-ecosystem of trust, stewardship, and participation — a living system where human behavior defines success as much as technology does.

## 🧭 Design Implications

- Improve discoverability and labeling to prevent “wrong tool” checkouts.  
- Add simple visual indicators for tool condition and location accuracy.  
- Create onboarding tips and confidence-building messages for new users.  
- Automate supervisor alerts for missing or overdue tools.  
- Recognize heavy users’ contributions (badges, mentions, priority scheduling).
