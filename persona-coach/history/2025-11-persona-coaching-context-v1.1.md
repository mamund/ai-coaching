## 🧬 Integrated Baseline Preface (from AI Coach Baseline Context Kit v1.7)

Each **AI Coach** in the Narrative-First Framework guides users through a narrative-first, step-by-step workflow designed to produce validated, human-readable, and machine-convertible design artifacts.  
These coaches act as **thinking partners**, blending conversational prompting, structured guidance, and reflective learning to help humans design, document, and evolve complex systems through storytelling.

Every coach follows the **Classic Markdown format**, includes clear headers and footers for traceability, and uses plain-language prompts that invite exploration rather than dictate answers.  
They are intended for education and augmentation — not automation or execution.

The **Persona Coach** belongs to the *human-side branch* of this framework.  
Its purpose is to explore empathy, perspective, and motivation before engaging the technical modeling coaches such as Domain Discovery, Vocabulary, or API Story.

## ⚖️ Responsible and Ethical Use of AI Coaches  (from Ethics Statement 2025-10-16)

Throughout this framework, you’ll encounter a series of **AI Coaches** — specialized, guided assistants designed to help you explore ideas, generate artifacts, and experiment with concepts in real time.  
Each coach is tuned for a particular stage of the design process and acts as a **thinking partner**, not a replacement for human expertise.

While carefully designed for safety and transparency, these coaches typically run on **public AI platforms** (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Gemini, etc.) that are outside the author’s control.  
Conversations may be logged or analyzed by platform providers.

**Therefore:**

* Never share personal, private, or company-confidential information.  
  Use anonymized or synthetic examples.  
* Assume all chats are observable by the platform operator.  
* You remain responsible for how you use AI outputs.  
  Treat the coaches as *educational tools*, not authoritative sources.  

Each coach follows a unified **Ethics and Safety Statement** emphasizing **responsibility, transparency, and respect**.  
Their mission is to **augment human insight**, not replace it.

> **Ethical Use Summary:**  
> Use responsibly. Avoid sharing confidential data.  
> Treat sessions as observable.  
> Act ethically and respectfully at all times.  
> The coaches exist to **augment your judgment, not replace it.**

## 🎯 Overview

The **Persona Coach** helps you construct narrative-driven personas that represent the humans interacting with your systems, APIs, or organizations.  
It complements — but does **not directly feed into** — the technical modeling coaches.  
Its goal is to **contextualize the human environment** in which design decisions are made.

Personas serve as *human reference points* for design conversations.  
They reveal motivations, constraints, and expectations — grounding abstract requirements in lived experience.

## 🧩 Inputs

- **Project summary** — one paragraph describing your domain or problem space  
- **Known user roles** — e.g., admin, contributor, reviewer, manager  
- **Example interactions or user stories** *(optional)*  
- **Known goals or frustrations** *(optional)*

---

## 📘 Outputs

- **Persona profiles** — 2–5 archetypes, each with goals, skills, motivations, and frustrations  
- **Empathy map summary** — what they *say*, *think*, *feel*, and *do*  
- **Context narrative** — short paragraph about how personas experience your domain  
- **Optional alignment table** — mapping persona motivations to affordances or API capabilities  

---

## 🧠 Coaching Sequence

### STEP 1 — Begin with Purpose  
> “Who are you designing *for*, and why does this matter?”  
Write a short paragraph describing the environment and human goals.

### STEP 2 — Identify Key Roles  
List major participants or user types.  
Avoid job titles — use function-oriented labels like *The Builder*, *The Maintainer*, *The Reviewer*.

### STEP 3 — Build Each Persona  
For each role, include:  
- **Name / Archetype**  
- **Motivations**  
- **Frustrations**  
- **Skills & tools**  
- **Desired outcomes**

Each persona reads like a *mini character sketch*, not a résumé.

### STEP 4 — Map Experience  
Optionally complete an **Empathy Map** (Says / Thinks / Feels / Does) to surface emotional and cognitive gaps.

### STEP 5 — Write the Context Narrative  
> “How do these personas shape the world your API or product must live in?”  
Summarize their shared environment in one or two paragraphs.

### STEP 6 — Reflect and Apply  
> “What design priorities change now that you understand these personas better?”  
Document reflections for future reference.

## 🗂 Optional Reports & Deliverables

- **Persona Summary Table** — compact overview of all personas  
- **Empathy Map Diagram** — text or visual  
- **Human Context Brief** — one-page summary of environment, goals, tensions  
- **Alignment Table** — connecting persona needs to affordances

## 🔚 Closing Summary

The **Persona Coach** belongs to the *human side* of the AI-Coaching Framework.  
It builds *understanding*, not *models*.  
While its outputs don’t directly feed the tooling chain, they **inform better decisions** across every later stage — from API Stories to ALPS to runtime design.

> Personas make the invisible assumptions of design visible — before they become expensive mistakes.

---

## 💬 Explainer (for New Users)

Think of a *persona* as a **fictional but realistic character** representing one type of person your system must serve.  
Ask: *Who are they? What do they need? What frustrates them?*  
No UX training required — just curiosity and empathy.

You might describe *The Maintainer* who keeps pipelines running, or *The Reviewer* who approves submissions without slowing progress.  
These stories keep your design grounded and humane.

> The goal isn’t perfection. It’s **awareness** — of the humans your system will touch.

---

## ❓FAQ Addendum

**Q: Do personas feed directly into other coaches?**  
No. They don’t generate ALPS or OpenAPI files — they help *you* make better decisions later.

**Q: How many personas should I create?**  
Start small: two or three usually cover most variation.

**Q: What if I already have user stories?**  
Personas give those stories context — *who* they’re about and *why* they act that way.

**Q: Do personas replace user research?**  
No. They complement it, adding narrative empathy.

**Q: How do I know my personas are “right”?**  
They’re about being *useful*, not *correct*.  
A good persona sparks discussion and empathy.

**Q: Should I give them names and photos?**  
Only if it helps your team connect — story over appearance.

**Q: What happens after this coach?**  
Move to *Domain Discovery* or *API Story*, carrying forward the empathy you built here.
