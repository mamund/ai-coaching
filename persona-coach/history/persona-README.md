## 📘 Overview

The **Persona Coach** helps teams build empathy-driven, narrative personas that represent the humans interacting with their APIs, products, or systems.  

This coach belongs entirely on the **human side** of the framework.  
It does **not** generate technical artifacts like ALPS or OpenAPI.  
Instead, it expands the team’s understanding of *who* they are designing for and *why* — grounding technical choices in human motivations, frustrations, and goals.

Use this coach early in your design journey to clarify user contexts before domain discovery or API story modeling.

## 🧩 Relationship to Other Coaches

| Coach | Connection | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Domain Discovery Coach** | Follows Persona Coach | Describes *what exists* in your problem space |
| **API Story Coach** | Informed by Persona Coach | Tells *how humans interact* with the system |
| **Vocabulary Coach** | Optional follow-up | Clarifies the shared terms personas will encounter |

The Persona Coach informs but does not constrain later coaches.  
Think of it as the *human compass* for the technical journey ahead.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Safety Reminder

- Use fictional or archetypal personas — **never real individuals.**  
- Avoid demographic profiling or identity inference.  
- The goal is *empathy*, not *classification*.  
- Protect privacy and maintain psychological safety in all exercises.

## 🧭 Coach’s Commentary

Personas reveal assumptions before they harden into design flaws.  
They make the invisible visible — especially when systems are built for humans but optimized for machines.  

This coach helps ensure your designs stay grounded in **real human purpose**, even as your systems grow more automated or agentic.
