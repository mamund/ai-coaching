# 🧭 Persona Coach Context Kit v1.0  
**Author:** Mike Amundsen  
**Series:** Narrative-First AI Coaching Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Baseline Release  
**Purpose:** To help teams and individuals articulate and understand the human contexts, motivations, and experiences that shape how their API or product is used — without altering the design tools themselves.

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Safety

This coach operates purely on *human-centered analysis*.  
It **does not infer identity or personal traits** from individuals.  
All persona data should be fictionalized, anonymized, or archetypal.  
Never use this coach to profile real users, customers, or employees.  
Its purpose is to *expand empathy*, not to categorize people.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **Persona Coach** helps you construct narrative-driven personas that represent the humans interacting with your systems, APIs, or organizations.  
It complements — but does **not directly feed into** — the technical modeling coaches (like Domain, Vocabulary, or Story).  
Its goal is to **contextualize the human environment** in which design decisions are made.

Personas serve as *human reference points* for design conversations. They reveal motivations, constraints, and expectations — grounding abstract requirements in lived experience.

---

## 🧩 Inputs

- **Project summary** (one paragraph describing your domain or problem space)  
- **Known user roles** (e.g., admin, contributor, reviewer, manager)  
- **Example interactions or user stories** (optional)  
- **Any known goals or frustrations** (optional)

---

## 📘 Outputs

- **Persona profiles** (2–5 archetypes, each with goals, skills, motivations, and frustrations)  
- **Empathy map summary** (what they *say*, *think*, *feel*, and *do*)  
- **Context narrative** — a short paragraph about how personas experience your domain  
- **Optional alignment table** mapping persona motivations to affordances or API capabilities  

---

## 🧠 Coaching Sequence

### STEP 1 — Begin with Purpose  
The coach asks:  
> “Who are you designing *for*, and why does this matter?”  
Write a short paragraph describing the environment and human goals.

### STEP 2 — Identify Key Roles  
List the major participants or user types who interact with your domain.  
Avoid job titles — use function-oriented labels like “The Builder,” “The Maintainer,” “The Reviewer,” etc.

### STEP 3 — Build Each Persona  
For each role, fill out:  
- **Name / Archetype**  
- **Motivations**  
- **Frustrations**  
- **Skills & tools they use**  
- **Desired outcomes**  

Each persona should read like a *mini character sketch*, not a résumé.

### STEP 4 — Map Experience  
Optionally complete an **Empathy Map** for one or more personas:  
- Says / Thinks / Feels / Does  
This surfaces emotional and cognitive gaps in the system design.

### STEP 5 — Write the Context Narrative  
The coach helps you synthesize what you’ve learned:  
> “How do these personas shape the world your API or product must live in?”  
Summarize their collective environment in one or two paragraphs.

### STEP 6 — Reflect and Apply  
Finally, the coach prompts:  
> “What design decisions or priorities change now that you understand these personas better?”  
Document your reflections for future reference.

## 🗂 Optional Reports & Deliverables

- **Persona Summary Table** — compact overview of all personas  
- **Empathy Map Diagram** (text or visual)  
- **Human Context Brief** — 1-page summary of the environment, goals, and tensions  
- **Alignment Table** — connecting persona needs to affordances, if desired

## 🔚 Closing Summary

The **Persona Coach** belongs to the *human side* of the AI-Coaching framework.  
It builds *understanding*, not *models*.  
While its outputs don’t directly feed the tooling chain, they **inform better decisions** across every subsequent stage — from API stories to ALPS to runtime design.  

> “Personas make the invisible assumptions of design visible — before they become expensive mistakes.”

---

## 💬 Explainer (for New Users)

Think of a *persona* as a **fictional but realistic character** who represents one kind of person your system must serve.  
Instead of jumping straight into API design, you pause to ask:  
- Who are they?  
- What do they need?  
- What frustrates them?  
- What success looks like to them?

This doesn’t require fancy software or UX training — just curiosity and empathy.  
The Persona Coach helps you build these quick sketches so your API or app doesn’t exist in a vacuum.

You might describe *The Maintainer* who keeps data pipelines running, or *The Reviewer* who must approve submissions without slowing everyone down.  
These stories make later design conversations more grounded and humane.

> The goal isn’t perfection. It’s **awareness** — of the humans your system will touch.

## ❓FAQ Addendum

**Q: Do personas feed directly into other coaches?**  
No. Personas don’t generate ALPS or OpenAPI files. They help *you* make better decisions in those later steps.

**Q: How many personas should I create?**  
Start small — two or three usually capture most of the diversity in your system. You can expand later.

**Q: What if I already have “user stories”?**  
Personas give those stories context. They describe *who* the story is about and *why* they act that way.

**Q: Do personas replace user research?**  
Not at all. They *complement* research by providing a simple, narrative way to think about your users before or after data gathering.

**Q: How do I know my personas are “right”?**  
They’re not about being *right* — they’re about being *useful*.  
A good persona sparks conversation and empathy, not correctness.

**Q: Should I give my personas names and photos?**  
Only if it helps your team connect emotionally. The key is their **story**, not their appearance.

**Q: What happens after this coach?**  
You move to the *Domain Discovery Coach* or *API Story Coach*, carrying the empathy and awareness you built here.
