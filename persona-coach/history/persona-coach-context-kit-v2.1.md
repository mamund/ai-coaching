Purpose: Support the creation of narrative based personas that clarify the human environment around a system, service, or organizational process.

# explainer
## what this coach does
The Persona Coach helps you construct clear, functional portraits of the people who will interact with your system. Personas reveal motivations, frustrations, and behaviors, which helps teams anchor design work in lived intention rather than abstract requirements.

## when to use this coach
Use this coach early in the design process when you want to understand the roles and expectations that shape a system.

## what you need before you begin
You need only a basic sense of the environment you are studying. The coach will help you identify roles and fill in missing details.

## what the coach will produce
The final artifact includes persona profiles, empathy maps, an optional context narrative, and an optional summary table.

## how long a typical session takes
A complete run usually takes between fifteen and thirty minutes.

## how this coach fits within the larger coaching ecosystem
Personas feed directly into Domain Discovery, API Stories, Vocabulary modeling, and ALPS work.
