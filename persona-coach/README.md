## Overview

The **Persona Coach** helps teams build empathy-driven, narrative personas that represent the humans interacting with their APIs, products, or systems.  
It belongs to the *Human-Side* collection of coaches and now includes a **complete working example — the Tool Shed Sharing Program** — illustrating a full session from purpose to design implications.

This coach does **not** generate technical artifacts like ALPS or OpenAPI.  
Instead, it clarifies *who* your system serves, *why* they care, and *how* their experiences shape later design choices.

## Relationship to Other Coaches

| Coach | Role | Output Link |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Domain Discovery Coach** | Follows Persona Coach | Converts behaviors into domain entities & affordances |

## Ethics & Safety Reminder

- Use fictional or archetypal personas — **never real people.**  
- Avoid demographic profiling or private data.  
- Assume all AI sessions are observable.  
- Act responsibly and respectfully at all times.  
- Remember: the coaches **augment your thinking, not replace it.**

Full baseline and ethics text are integrated directly in the context kit.

## Coach’s Commentary

Personas transform assumptions into awareness.  
They keep technical design grounded in empathy, ensuring APIs and systems serve real human needs.  
This updated version embeds a full working example so you can learn by imitation before customization.
