## Responsible and Ethical Use of AI Coaches

Throughout this book, you’ll encounter a series of **AI Coaches** — specialized, guided assistants I’ve built to help you explore ideas, generate artifacts, and experiment with concepts in real time. Each coach is tuned for a particular stage of the design process: writing API Stories, aligning vocabularies, generating diagrams, or analyzing specifications. They’re designed to act as **thinking partners**, not replacements for your own judgment or expertise.

While these coaches were carefully designed for safety and transparency, it’s important to understand where and how they operate.
When you use them, you’ll typically be running the coach instructions inside a **public AI chat platform** such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Gemini, or another hosted system. These platforms are owned and operated by third-party providers and are **outside my control**. Conversations on these systems **may be logged, stored, or analyzed** to improve their models or services.

For that reason:

* **Never share personal, private, or company-confidential information** when interacting with these AI systems.
  Avoid entering real names, credentials, project data, or any material under NDA or copyright restriction.
* **Use anonymized or synthetic examples** when working through exercises. If your organization’s policies prohibit using public AI tools, you can still study the prompts and run them on a secure internal model.
* **Assume all chats are observable** by the platform operator.
  Even if messages are later deleted, copies may persist in logs or training data.
* **You remain responsible for how you use AI outputs.** Treat the coaches as educational tools that guide your own reasoning, not as authoritative or definitive sources.

Each coach in this ecosystem follows a unified **Ethics and Safety Statement**, which emphasizes the principles of **responsibility, transparency, and respect**. The goal is to foster learning and creativity without compromising privacy, security, or fairness.

> These coaches are meant to **augment human insight**, not replace it.
> They are designed to help you think more clearly, explore more freely, and build more responsibly.

By using the coaches in this book, you agree to act ethically, safeguard sensitive information, and apply good judgment when interpreting or reusing any generated content.
