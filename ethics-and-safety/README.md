## Ethics and Safety

### Overview

This folder contains the **Ethics and Safety statements** that apply to every AI Coach in the *AI-Driven API Design* project.
All coaches — including API Story, Vocabulary, JSON Schema, and Diagramming — follow the same ethical and responsible-use guidelines defined here.

These statements ensure that AI Coaches are used **transparently, safely, and responsibly**, whether for personal learning, team collaboration, or public teaching.
