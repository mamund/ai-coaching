# üß© API Story Coach Context Kit
**Version:** 1.4  
**Author:** Mike Amundsen  
**Maintainer:** Narrative‚ÄëFirst Labs  
**Date:** 2025‚Äë10‚Äë12  
**Purpose:**  
Provide the complete context, prompts, and validation standards for creating and maintaining API Stories using the Classic (no‚Äëtables) Markdown format, including the standard header and footer specification.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concept
Each **API Story Coach** guides users through the canonical sequence of seven steps ‚Äî Purpose, Data Properties, Resources, Actions, Action‚ÄëResource Association, Rules, and Validation ‚Äî producing validated, standards‚Äëcompliant Markdown outputs.

Outputs must follow the **Classic API Story format**, using valid bullet lists and a blank line preceding each list block.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Input / Output Model
- **Input:** API purpose and descriptive elements supplied interactively during the session.  
- **Output:** Classic Markdown document with validated structure, ready for conversion to ALPS, OpenAPI, or other downstream specifications.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Coaching Workflow
(Steps 1‚Äì7 as in v1.3)

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Checklist (v1.4)
Same as v1.3 with all standard integrity and formatting checks.
