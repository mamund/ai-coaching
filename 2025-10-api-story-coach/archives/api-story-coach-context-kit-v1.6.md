## Preface

This *Self-Contained Teaching Edition* of the **API Story Coach Context Kit** is designed for onboarding, live instruction, and self-guided learning.

It combines the full API Story coaching workflow with a complete worked example to demonstrate each section in practice.
Educators and learners can use this edition to understand both *how* the API Story process works and *why* each design decision matters.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction for First-Time Users

An **API Story** is a short narrative that describes what an API does, what information it handles, and what people or systems can do with it.
You don‚Äôt need prior API experience‚Äîjust describe purpose, data, and actions.
When finished, you‚Äôll have a clear, readable artifact that can later be converted automatically into specifications like ALPS or OpenAPI.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The API Story Concept

An API Story models an API as a *story about interaction* rather than a list of endpoints.
It captures:

* **Purpose** ‚Äì Why the API exists.
* **Data Properties** ‚Äì The key pieces of information.
* **Resources** ‚Äì The views or entities users encounter.
* **Actions** ‚Äì What users or agents can do.
* **Rules** ‚Äì The constraints that keep the system valid.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Seven-Step Coaching Workflow

1. **Purpose** ‚Äì Describe the API‚Äôs goal, audience, and outcome.
2. **Data Properties** ‚Äì List key data elements with examples.
3. **Resources** ‚Äì Define main views (home, collections, items).
4. **Actions** ‚Äì Describe operations users can perform.
5. **Associate Actions with Resources** ‚Äì Map where each action appears.
6. **Rules** ‚Äì List business and validation constraints.
7. **Validation Summary** ‚Äì Confirm readiness for conversion.

Plain-language prompts help beginners (e.g., *‚ÄúWhat can someone do here?‚Äù*).
Each generated section includes a short explanatory paragraph except Purpose.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Action‚ÄìResource Association Rules

* Every resource must expose ‚â• 1 action.
* Every action must appear on ‚â• 1 resource.
* Include `showHome` in all resources.
* Maintain navigation pairs (`viewList` ‚Üî `viewItem`).
* Association integrity is checked before final validation.
